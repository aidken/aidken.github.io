Want to add a nice appearance on my web app. Bootstrap should be a good choice. A sample site is [here](https://szw6q.csb.app/).


### Github Pages: Define publishing source
##### Friday, November 27th, 2020

Successfully launched my Github page, finally after a few weeks. You have to [define the publishing source](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site)
within your repo. My default settings had branch `main` as the publishing source, but my branch is actually `master`.

Good. I tried to solve a problem of my Gihub page, and could solve it.
