##### Github Pages: Define publishing source

You have to [define the publishing source](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site)
within your repo. My default settings had branch `main` as the publishing source, but my branch is actually `master`.
